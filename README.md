**Computational Text Analysis - 9/11 and Gilmore Girls
**

The goal of this project was primarily to combine two of my primary interests: teen dramas and American politics. 

In this project, I investigated what impact, if any, 9/11 had on the television series Gilmore Girls through compuataional text analysis, including word frequency anlaysis. Through these methods, I sought to uncover any change in words related to 9/11 between seasons one and three of Gilmore Girls, which were released in 2000 and 2002 respectively.
